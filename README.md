# Small AI/ML/DL Projects

This repository contains a collection of small projects that demonstrate practical applications of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)**. Each project is designed to showcase different techniques and algorithms in these fields, providing hands-on examples of how these technologies can be applied to real-world problems.


## Usage

Each project directory contains a `main.py` or similar script that you can run to see the application in action. For example:
